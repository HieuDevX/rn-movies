# React Native Movies App - powered by TMDB Api

This is an application as a mean to practice React Native using TMDB Api. This is written fully in TypeScript. And this is still a WIP. Only two screens have been done

## Technologies
1. React / ReactNative
2. TypeScript
3. React Navigation
4. React Native Elements
5. Redux / Redux Observable with Typesafe Actions
6. Axios / Date-fns
...along with some other libraries...

## Installation and run

As any other RN application on Github, what you need to do:
1. Well, get setup for React Native
2. Clone this repo
3. Install the dependencies with `yarn` or `npm`
4. Run `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`

## Todos
- [ ] Galleries `Lightbox` in `MediaDetail`
- [ ] Master Search component for both `Movie` and `TvShow`
- [ ] Linking `trailer` to `Youtube`
- [ ] Implement TMDb's Authentication
 1. [ ] Login as Member
 2. [ ] Rate media
 3. [ ] CRUD Playlist
- [ ] Implement Settings screen
 1. [ ] Profile Screen
 2. [ ] Some specific settings that I can't think of at the moment
